This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: an infinite loop caused by a missing dependency array.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises because the effect runs after every render, triggering a re-render, leading to an infinite loop. The solution involves adding the `count` variable to the dependency array, ensuring the effect only runs when the `count` value changes.
